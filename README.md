## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a **Senior Front-End Developer** with strong expertise in **JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.js**, currently expanding into **full-stack development**. My background in **hospitality and real estate** has honed my ability to understand user needs, problem-solving, and client interactions.  

With **years of professional experience**, I stand out for my ability to **quickly grasp new concepts**, **optimize existing solutions**, and **mentor junior developers**. My strong **soft skills** and technical versatility have led me to take on responsibilities beyond coding, including representing my company at client sites.  

I am currently working on my **startup, "Connecting Beyond,"** which digitalizes memorials by integrating **QR codes with online tribute pages**. This project is built using **Next.js, Supabase, and PostgreSQL**, and is part of my transition to full-stack development.  

My tech journey is driven by a **love for problem-solving, continuous learning, and exploring cutting-edge technologies**.
