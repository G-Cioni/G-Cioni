As a passionate Front End Developer with a rich background in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.js, I blend a unique history in hospitality and real estate with technical prowess, offering a nuanced understanding of user needs. My multilingual fluency in English, Italian, and Spanish complements my technical skills, enabling me to excel in diverse and dynamic team environments. Currently, I am on a quest to transition into full-stack development, driven by my curiosity and love for continuous learning in technology.
